# Data-Visualisation-Human-happiness
Data visualisation of human happiness in comparison to factors


The main dataset used in this assignment came from 
Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/world-happiness-report-2005-2021.)


This was a dataset compiled from the world happiness report from 2005-2021. This dataset was 
appealing as it; even at first glance, provided insight into trends across countries and continents 
based on happiness and socio-economic levels. This data was merged with a latitude and longitude 
dataset of each country and also with a dataset that had each continent.(provided) These were both taken from 
Kaggle but cleaned up first. The dataset was cleaned firstly to only show values from 2011-2021, a 
ten year period. This allowed a considerable time frame but also allowed a lot more countries to be 
involved as many countries had no records before 2010.Some countries did not have full records 
from 2011-2021 but these were still included as it provided valuable data and as averages were used 
was still credible data for plots.
